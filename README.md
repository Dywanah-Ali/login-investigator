# Login Investigator

Analyses a synthetic authentication log, flags suspicious sign-ins, and investigates them with an
AI agent. This is version 2: the same application as v1, moved from a Streamlit app to a FastAPI
backend and a React frontend built with shadcn/ui.

> **Synthetic data.** Every user, sign-in and attack in this project is generated. No real or
> personal data is used. The attacker IP addresses are publicly reported abuse sources.

## Layout

| Folder | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `backend/` | The Python project, run by uv: the core package `login_investigator`, data, tests and evals |
| `frontend/` | The React app. Empty placeholder for now |
| `docs/` | The API contract, the migration brief, the bug log, the prompt log and the agent guides |

The core in `backend/login_investigator` is copied from v1 unchanged and imports neither Streamlit
nor FastAPI. A boundary test enforces that.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- An OpenRouter API key for the agent, and optionally an AbuseIPDB API key

## Setup

```bash
cd backend
uv sync                 # installs Python 3.12 and the exact versions in uv.lock
cp env.example .env     # then put your keys into .env, which is git-ignored
```

## Test

```bash
cd backend
uv run pytest
```

## Run

Two terminals, one per server.

```bash
# Terminal 1: the API (to be filled in when the API exists)
# Terminal 2: the frontend (to be filled in when the frontend exists)
```
