# Bug Log

Bugs found while building v2, logged when they are found. Real problems are kept, not cleaned away.
v1's bug log stays in the v1 repository; this log starts again at B-001.

**Symptom:** the spec and ticket 10 expect 259 core and agent tests. The copied tests collect 254.
**Cause:** the planning count, not the copy. `.scratch/v2-port/v1-facts.md` records that v1 collects
290 tests, and that the screen files hold 13 and 18 test functions. 290 minus 31 gives 259. But 290
counts collected tests, and `test_app.py` is parametrised: its 13 functions collect as 18 tests. The
subtraction mixed functions with collected tests. Collected per file, the screen files hold 36 (18
and 18), which leaves 254. Rechecked on a fresh export of v1's last commit: 290 collected, 254 outside
the two screen files.
**Fix:** none to the code. The evidence on ticket 10 names 254, and a spec correction is proposed to
the author, since spec changes go through the author. The same 259 appears in ticket 08, ticket 11
and the map, so the correction covers all four.
**Lesson:** subtract like from like. A count that becomes an acceptance gate should come from the
tool's own output for exactly the set it describes.
**Found by:** test run of the copied suite, checked against a collect-only run of a scratch copy of
v1. Related prompt: P-001.
